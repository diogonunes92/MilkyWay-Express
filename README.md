+## MilkyWay-Express
+
+You start the game with a credit of $10 and your aim is to earn enough money throughout the game to pay back this loan when the game ends.
+You will take turns moving your Spaceship on cards laid out as a chart of the Milky Way Galaxy, discovering new Planets as you go. You will throw a dice to determine what goods will be on offer at each planet. Available goods will vary from turn to turn, so buy low and sell high while the market is friendly to you. But if luck abandons you, you may be driven to Bankruptcy by greedy Pirates and zealous Customs controls (if you dare to smuggle any illegal goods).
+The game ends when you turn over the last unexplored card on the Galactic Chart, or when you run out of money.

+This work was made within the course of "Advanced Programming". To adapt this game to a PC platform we used Java language. The game not only can be played on the command line but it also has a graphic view and for that we used the MVC model, so the code is well structed to meet that criteria.
